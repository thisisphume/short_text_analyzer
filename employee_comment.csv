I do not believe that choosing just one topic in the beginning, to focus on for the entirety of the rest of the survey is a good idea. There should be a component/question set for each topic (does not mean it has to be lengthy). Otherwise there will be a disproportionate amount of feedback for each topic, and there will be insufficient data for some categories to draw meaningful conclusions from as you cant guarantee an equal amount of people choosing those topics. Please do Better."

So, I like the general approach/philosophy, but I would actually like to see a few more multiple choice questions to give managers more concrete data to take insight from rather than relying potentially too much on the people who provide open-ended verbatim feedback... because the people who speak up are most often the ones who are either most loyal or most unhappy, when in reality it's the ""Neutrals"" (disengaged but caring) people who we really need to get to, listen to, and understand."
